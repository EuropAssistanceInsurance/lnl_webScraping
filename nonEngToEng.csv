SHAME (SHAME) to (to) EUROP ASSISTANCE,09/03/2020 14:53,2,1,"Shame on Europ Assistance who rejected (on 23/10) in Mexico our request for help following the fracture of my wife's femur!  The interlocutor who never wanted to give me his name to pretend that a previous accident of my wife rejected his request of assumption of responsibility.  (Insurance via MasterCard Card).  The summit of SHAME was reached when he told me to meet the French Embassy!  I insisted that no one had examined my wife and that it was impossible to say 10,000 km.  His only answer was to ask me to see the embassy.  All the while, my wife was in the femur.  She was fractured for several hours.  I plan to follow up this case when we return to FRANCE.

The height of SHAME was reached when he told me to see the French Embassy! I insisted, pointing out that no one had examined my wife and that at 10,000 km you could not say that.

Execrable,20/08/2018 11:55,7,1,"Hello, I will talk about my experience with Europ Assistance, as I know it will be consulted all over the world, I will then translate it into English Hello, I am going to talk about my experience with Europ Assistance, as I know it will be consulted all over the world, I will then translate it into Francais , it is a name that they give themselves because they do not have the right to put certified by…. Fraud: it is already present when you pay with your CB Visa or Master Card for your problems on the spot therefore useless to 'subscribe to it. If you have a Premium card, you are even covered in the event of a missed flight. If you don't have it yet, you could get it at half price between 50 and 70 €. Think about it, it's 100% winning. The Europ Assistance group achieved sales of nearly 1.5 billion euros in 2016, nearly two million more than in 2014. See the STATISTA.com website. Share capital € 35,402,786. This makes us tiny in the face of this giant.Here is my experience: I took out via Paypal (which has absolutely nothing to do with and which seems very bothered by the number of claims) this insurance supposedly complete for the family for 28 euros / year The conditions here: Paypal insurance I am in Malaysia ready to leave for Langkawi, who knows Kuala Lumpur very well imagine the traffic on a Saturday noon. Where it will take 30 minutes to make the trip Bintang - airport we took 90 minutes. We arrived 10 minutes after checking in. The company did not want to negotiate. Believing myself to be protected, I bought 2 new tickets. At the counter in front of a line of customers after their refusal, I paid, they took my luggage, I gave way to the next one. You who have already taken the plane know the queues. On my return, I contacted Europ Assistance who was to answer me within 3 days but I had to re-launch them for an answer after 5 days. I am however within my rights and the closed ones But their answer is to prove why I could not take the plane: medical certificate of the doctor or the hospital or any supporting documents. I am not in that situation and I explain to them after sending the original invoice and a second purchase made while the original aircraft was still on the tarmac. All this in order not to reimburse 180 € so imagine if it is your ticket at 900 € To be reimbursed, you would need proof so: 1) A receipt for the time the taxi dropped me off at the airport due to heavy traffic when he could not park 2) A certificate that I had to take another flight while the one planned was still on the tarmac. The reason was that the recording was over. I was at an airport with an incredible number of tourists leaving for an idyllic island. I paid, we took my suitcases and I let the next ones take my place, no time to discuss, I tried to negotiate without success 3) I was not able to ask the pilot for proof of why he did not wait for us, he was on his plane Even if I had all this I will be asked to return to Malaysia and find the hostess who sold me the ticket, all this so as not to pay 180 € I contacted my Legal Assistance which claims that they have to pay but given the situation it is according to their will. For a company that makes hundreds of millions of net profits a year there is something wrong with this. I also caution you: if you get hit by a reckless driver and haven't picked up the car number. car you risk not being covered. You would have understood that Europ Assistance is a scam and they cannot deny it. You pay 99% for your tickets on the internet, so with your credit card. There they offer you exactly the same insurance for 50 € more. Do you have a Premium card? You don't need any insurance: Mondial Assistance or Europ Assistance for anything. Flee Europ Assistance you are in danger I do not allow this company a right of reply, that would be a lack of respect and an insult in the face of the veracity of my statements Hello, I will talk about my experience with Europ Assistance, as I know that it will be consulted throughout the world, I will then translate it into EnglishHello, I am going to talk about my experience with Europ Assistance, as I know it will be consulted all over the world, I will then translate it into EnglishSays Euro Assistance : ""One mark of trust 2017"" that absolutely mean nothing, we find the same on supermarkets, cheeses, cakes, yoghurt, is a name that they give because they do not have the right to put certified by ...

1 star is still too much for this …,07/07/2020 10:05,2,1,"1 star is still too much for this insurance! The trip, booked through Opodo, was canceled early, in November 2019, due to cancer. Until the company even reacts. Only after I posted something publicly on their Facebook page. Documents were submitted by post and email. New documents were always requested, often twice. And in between there were always weeks of waiting. Eventually it was rejected, allegedly there was another email why and why. It is still not there today !! Over 300 € just for the insurance cover, which is actually none at all, and the travel expenses. Everything gone! That seems to me to be common practice with this insurance, if you look at the reviews on the Internet. I will now bring in a lawyer and take legal action. I also address the public, i.e. TV and print media! What this club pulls off is the very last thing and must be stopped!",de,07/07/2020,7,7,Tuesday,10:00,05/07/2020,01/07/2020,de
Urgent warning! Amounted to!,15/06/2020 13:15,1,1,"Europ Assistance is not insurance, it is a waste. I have insured a transatlantic trip with my girlfriend for cancellation and termination. Unfortunately, we actually had to cancel the trip due to an unforeseeable event. All attempts to speak to the insurance company beforehand have failed. No response to emails, broken websites, customer center staff speak neither German nor English nor French, I think this is a special Indian dialect. After unauthorized return tried to assert claims, all contract conditions were met. There were even times when untrue facts were insisted. Things were alleged that I could demonstrably refute with the terms of the contract. We suffered unlawful damage of over € 1000. Lawyer said it would not be worth it, since the company is based in France, the effort would be high financial risk. I would like to speak to someone who really works for this ""company"", not just in a foreign call center, I feel sorry for the people myself. Please do not book anything there. The € 1000 loss is one thing, the most annoying thing is the € 80 booking fee for this ""insurance"". Hopefully the managing director accidentally uses the money to put the wrong fuel in his Porsche. Constructive criticism: create a functioning damage report website, hire a call center with employees who are capable of communicating, pay customers who are contractually entitled to money. Also read through contracts yourself, be an insurance company or look for another job.",de,15/06/2020,6,15,Monday,13:30,14/06/2020,01/06/2020,de

The insurance offered by Opodo,19/03/2020 14:48,3,1,"The insurance offered by Opodo is a total mockery, which (in my case) you can save 52 euros. Due to the general crisis, I tried to get an earlier return flight via Opodo and Europ Assistance. No one was available for 2 days (mail, chat, phone). After my return, which I financed out of my own pocket, I immediately contacted Ms. stefanie_mueller at europ-assistance.at by email and described the case in writing and sent all the documents along. Of course, nobody goes to the given phone number either. Meanwhile 4 working days have passed, neither a moo nor a muh. ""Mrs. Müller"", like everything about this ""insurance"", will be a fake.

My tip: NEVER TAKE A TRAVEL CANCELLATION INSURANCE!,09/03/2020 17:56,3,1,"I also publish my report for the second time ... !!! Is there any manipulation here? If I had only seen this page (Trustpilot) before taking out travel cancellation insurance ... apparently I'm not the only insured person from Europ Assistance who has been cheated ... This ""ominous"" insurance was recommended to me by CHECK 24 (after asking about the desired travel modalities). Almost half a year after taking out this insurance, I completely canceled my account with CHECK 24! And I was a CHECK 24 customer for many years. Any questions? And the Europ Assistance? In my opinion, the company is acting, to put it mildly, ""dubious""! I'll have my lawyer check this soon (luckily I have good legal protection insurance ... of course not through CHECK 24 and not with Europ Assistance either!). I have submitted and submitted a medical certificate etc. and all the necessary documents and steps on time - everything as it should be or as requested by Europ Assistance. Hoping that the travel cancellation insurance will take effect now! Nevertheless, the claim from the tour operator and thus my claim to Europ Assistance for the actual cancellation costs for the trip of ˜ € 1,000 (the full sum insured of the travel cancellation contract was just under € 4,500 !!!) will be refused by Europ Assistance insurance! With “unbelievable” and outrageous justifications, the company twists and turns like a worm. All of this at a moderate pace ... I was even willing to compromise and submitted various solutions to the insurance company in order to clarify the matter. Totally pointless. I'm angry about that now too. But right now I have a different focus. Unfortunately, my cancer diagnosis or cancer therapy was very unfavorable for me and I am currently in chemotherapy. In any case, I am extremely disappointed with this pseudo-insurance. In my opinion, this insurance must simply no longer have a future in this form and must be completely reorganized! How can you put an end to this insurance? After my chemotherapy I will be really active here ... maybe with the start of a class action or in the community with warning advertisements in newspapers and on social networks? It's a shame that such insurance as Europ Assistance is still available in the 21st century. Small addendum: *** Also the current advertisement from Europ Assistance for your travel cancellation insurance ... ""You have thought about your vacation ... but what if something happens ... no problem ... we are not only a travel cancellation insurance insurance - we are your personal travel assistance ...

It doesn't get any more dubious! Figner away !!,29/01/2020 11:38,3,1,"Had a round trip because of. say of a herniated disc. Luckily I have cancellation insurance, I thought. Far from it ... The tactic of this highly dubious insurance company is initially delay. You always want new receipts and certificates, and once you have laboriously procured and sent them away, you won't hear anything for six weeks. Then comes a letter asking for more documents. Etc. etc. You don't even have to try it over the phone, because the staff, who don't speak German very well, just don't want to understand you. After more than half a year, any payment has now been declined in a succinct email. Reason: The documents would have shown that my illness had already been treated six months prior to booking the trip. But this is absolutely not the case! I have now forwarded my case to the insurance ombudsman, let's see how it goes on ... What annoys me most about the matter is that this absolutely dubious insurance is also rated ""good"" by the Stiftung Wartentest.

Well, what now? The insurance company now wants an original medical certificate that I had a urinary tract infection. Hello? I went to an Australian urologist to find out that I did not have a sudden hearing loss ... The invoice also states exactly what it is about. I am supposed to present a doctor’s letter, otherwise payment will continue to be refused. Great ...

"Travel cancellation insurance - a bottomless impudence, hands off!",23/08/2019 16:42,2,1,"I can only warn against this insurance, even a star is grossly exaggerated. As already described many times in this forum, this insurance is characterized by a consistent delaying tactic. Forms and receipts are requested several times, one is wiped out in endless waiting loops with multiple connections back and forth between the departments, there are no confirmed callbacks. In the event of damage, especially abroad, that is extremely bitter. I report this insurance to BaFin and will take action against this association with a lawyer, consumer advice center and press.

In the event of a claim, no promises are made on the phone, nothing is organized by the insurance company and the settlement of the loss event is then delayed. So far we have been waiting 6 months for payment the costs incurred. Although we have booked a package tour, the cancellation insurance wants to have a tax portion of the unused return flight. The tour operator fti says he is not obliged to do so and cannot name an exact value because of margin taxation. And so it goes back and forth 6 times. A cheek how this insurance makes use of an attrition tactic to try to let customers sit at your expense. I'll call in a lawyer the next time I exchange correspondence. I canceled the insurance in good time when it expired, and you have to know that the great descriptions in the insurance flyer are just garbage that has nothing to do with the actual claims processing.",de,14/10/2018,10,14,Sunday,15:30,14/10/2018,01/10/2018,de
